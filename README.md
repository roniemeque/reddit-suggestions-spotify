# Reddit suggestions to Spotify playlists

I often stumble upon reddit posts with music suggestions that I would like to try, for example:

- [What’s a song that so funky, it makes you say “damn, that’s funky”?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gjwo5y/whats_a_song_that_so_funky_it_makes_you_say_damn/?sort=confidence)
- [What is your favorite one-hit wonder song?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gkjuht/what_is_your_favorite_onehit_wonder_song/)

Then I would crawl through the top comments individually searching the songs on Spotify - although it's quite a fun experience, it's really time consuming... so I thought:

**why not spend even more time developing an automation for it that probably won't pay off but will be cool to build???**

Well, here it is.
